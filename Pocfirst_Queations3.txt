3. Initialize On Object Creation
i. Create a class Car which contains wheels and model as Instance variables.
ii. Initialize the number of wheels of the car at the time of creating the Object of the 
car and assign the model of the car to the model variable and print the model after 
creating the object of the car class(not at the time of creating the object).

Code:
class Vehicle 
{
  int wheels;
  String model;

   public Vehicle(int w){
	   wheels=w;
   }
   public Vehicle(){
	   model = "Honda";
   }
}

class Car
{
  public static void main(String[] args) {
  
    Vehicle w = new Vehicle(4);
	Vehicle a = new Vehicle();

    System.out.println("the number of wheels of the car:" +w.wheels);
    System.out.println("the model of the car is:" +a.model);
  
}
}

Output:

C:\WorkSpaceEP\poc1>javac Car.java

C:\WorkSpaceEP\poc1>java Car
the number of wheels of the car:4
the model of the car is:Honda
